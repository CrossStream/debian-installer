<para>

Complete information concerning supported peripherals can be found at
<ulink url="&url-hardware-howto;">Linux Hardware Compatibility HOWTO</ulink>.
This section merely outlines the basics.

   <sect3><title>CPU</title>
<para>

Nearly all x86-based (IA-32) processors still in use in personal computers
are supported, including all varieties of Intel's "Pentium" series.
This also includes 32-bit AMD and VIA (former Cyrix) processors, and
processors like the Athlon XP and Intel P4 Xeon.

However, &debian; GNU/Linux &releasename; will <emphasis>not</emphasis> run
on 386 or earlier processors.  Despite the architecture name "i386", support
for actual 80386 processors (and their clones) was dropped with the Sarge
(r3.1) release of &debian;. (No version of Linux has ever supported the 286
or earlier chips in the series.)  All i486 and later processors are still
supported.

<note><para>

If your system has a 64-bit processor from the AMD64 or Intel 64 families,
you will probably want to use the installer for the amd64 architecture instead
of the installer for the (32-bit) i386 architecture.

   <sect3 id="bus"><title>I/O Bus</title>
<para>

The system bus is the part of the motherboard which allows the CPU to
communicate with peripherals such as storage devices.  Your computer
must use the ISA, EISA, PCI, PCIe, PCI-X, or VESA Local Bus (VLB, sometimes called the VL
bus).  Essentially all personal computers sold in recent years use one
of these.
