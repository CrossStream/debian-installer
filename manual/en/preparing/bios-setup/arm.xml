    <para>
      As already mentioned before, there is unfortunately no standard for
      system firmware on ARM systems.  Even the behaviour of different
      systems which use nominally the same firmware can be quite different. 
      This results from the fact that a large part of the devices using the
      ARM architecture are embedded systems, for which the manufacturers
      usually build heavily customized firmware versions and include
      device-specific patches.  Unfortunately the manufacturers often do not
      submit their changes and extensions back to the mainline firmware
      developers, so their changes are not integrated into newer versions of
      the original firmware.

    <para>
      As a result even newly sold systems often use a firmware that is based
      on a years-old manufacturer-modified version of a firmware whose
      mainline codebase has evolved a lot further in the meantime and offers
      additional features or shows different behaviour in certain aspects. 
      In addition to that, the naming of onboard devices is not consistent
      between different manufacturer-modified versions of the same firmware,
      therefore it is nearly impossible to provide usable
      product-independend instructions for ARM-based systems.
