"Under &debian-gnu;, it is much more likely that your OS can be repaired "
"rather than replaced if things go wrong. Upgrades never require a wholesale "
"installation; you can always upgrade in-place. And the programs are almost "

"requires newer supporting software, the &debian; packaging system ensures "
"that all the necessary software is automatically identified and installed. "
"The point is, much effort has been put into avoiding the need for re-"
"installation, so think of it as your very last option. The installer is "

"In order to install &debian-gnu; on a &arch-title; or zSeries machine you "
"have first boot a kernel into the system. The boot mechanism of this "
"platform is inherently different to other ones, especially from PC-like "
"systems: there are no floppy devices available at all. You will notice "
"another big difference while you work with this platform: most (if not all) "
"of the time you will work remote, with the help of some client session "
"software like telnet, or a browser. This is due to that special system "
"architecture where the 3215/3270 console is line-based instead of character-"
"based."

"Linux on this platform runs either natively on the bare machine, in a so-"
"called LPAR (Logical Partition) or in a virtual machine supplied by the VM "
"system. You can use a boot tape on all of those systems; you may use some "
"other boot media, too, but those may not be generally available. For "
"example, you can use the virtual card reader of a virtual machine, or boot "
"from the HMC (Hardware Management Console) of an LPAR if the HMC and this "
"option is available for you."

"Before you actually perform an installation, you have to go over some design "
"and preparation steps. IBM has made documentation available about the whole "
"process, e.g. how to prepare an installation medium and how actually to boot "
"from that medium. Duplicating that information here is neither possible nor "
"necessary. However, we will describe here which kind of &debian;-specific "
"data is needed and where to find it. Using both sources of information, you "
"have to prepare your machine and the installation medium before you can "
"perform a boot from it. When you see the welcome message in your client "
"session, return to this document to go through the &debian;-specific "
"installation steps."
